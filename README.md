The task was to create a quiz that included: 
  a timer
  score counter
  answer checker
  series of questions and grouped answers
  an alert of correct or incorrect submission
  a way to store data to local storage
  fields for the user to input their information for highscore competition
  
To complete this task, I utilized CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files.
