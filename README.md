To complete this basic quiz, I needed to create an outline HTML document that could easily be linked to a JavaScript file. 
In the JS file, several functions were necessary to complete various on-click events, creating the ability to save the user's scores to local storage, and to make the quiz questions and answers function properly. 
After outlining the quiz questions and their corrosponding answers list with correct answers specified. 
The end goal was to make the quiz run through all answers while the timer counted down, while applying a time decrement as punishment for getting an answer wrong, and to keep track of correct answers. 
A separate function plus in-order organization was necessary for all goals to work properly and in the correct sequence. 
After all the technical requirements were completed, I corrosponded an external CSS file with the code to add styling and additional organization. 
Because I used information created by others, I also gave credit to all the authors who provided the quotes used for the quiz.
